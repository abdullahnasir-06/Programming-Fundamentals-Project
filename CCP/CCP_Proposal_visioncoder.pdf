Project Proposal: Student Result Management
System
1. Project Title: Student Result Management System (SRMS)
2. Objective: The main objective of this project is to design and develop a system that can efficiently
manage, store, and retrieve student results. It will automate manual result processing, reduce
errors, and save time for both teachers and students.
3. Problem Statement: In many educational institutions, managing results manually is
time-consuming and error-prone. Teachers face challenges in calculating, recording, and sharing
results, while students sometimes receive delayed or incorrect results.
4. Proposed Solution: The proposed system will provide a centralized platform where: - Teachers
can enter marks and generate results automatically. - Students can view their results online. -
Administrators can manage student records, courses, and grades. - The system will ensure
accuracy, quick access, and data security.
5. Key Features: - Student registration and record management - Marks entry by teachers -
Automatic grade calculation and GPA generation - Result publishing and student access portal -
Search and filter option for quick result retrieval - Data backup and security
6. Tools & Technologies: - Programming Language: C - IDE: Dev C++, Visual Studio Code -
Interface: Console-based
7. Expected Outcome: - Faster and error-free result generation - Easy access for both teachers and
students - Improved efficiency in result management
8. Conclusion:The Student Result Management System will replace the traditional manual process
with a digital, reliable, and user-friendly solution, ensuring accuracy and saving valuable time.
